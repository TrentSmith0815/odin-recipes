    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Yes, another peanut butter recipe. This is the combination of two unique, and delicious burgers I have encounterd. The image above includes bacon, but my rendition does not.</p>
    <p>The first was the "Peanut Butter Burger I had in Destin, FL while on vacation.</p>
    <p>The second was an "Egg Burger" or "Brunch Burger" which they serve at many restaurants.</p>
    <p>To my knowledge, I have not seen a combination of the two being sold anywhere. And if so, the burger doesn't have as good a name.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</H2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 TBSP Peanut Butter (Preferrably Natural)</li>
            <li>1/3 LB of 80/20 or 70/30 ground beef</li>
            <li>1 Pasture Raised egg</li>
            <li>1 Brioche hamburger bun</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</H2>
         <ol>
            <li>Grill your burger to your desired internal temperature</li>
            <em>Optional: you may add salt and pepper to the ground beef, but no other spices are needed.</em>
            <li>While the burger is grilling, fry your egg to your desired temperature. I like mine "over medium" or "over hard" for this sandwich</li>
            <li>Turn off the grill and toast the buns for 1 minute</li>
            <li>Add peanut butter to the top slice of bun</li>
            <li>Place the cooked patty on the bottom slice, and top with your fried egg</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
