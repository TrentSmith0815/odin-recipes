    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Yes, another peanut butter recipe. This is the combination of two unique, and delicious burgers I have encounterd. The image above includes bacon, but my rendition does not.</p>
    <p>The first was the "Peanut Butter Burger I had in Destin, FL while on vacation.</p>
    <p>The second was an "Egg Burger" or "Brunch Burger" which they serve at many restaurants.</p>
    <p>To my knowledge, I have not seen a combination of the two being sold anywhere. And if so, the burger doesn't have as good a name.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</H2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 TBSP Peanut Butter (Preferrably Natural)</li>
            <li>1/3 LB of 80/20 or 70/30 ground beef</li>
            <li>1 Pasture Raised egg</li>
            <li>1 Brioche hamburger bun</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</H2>
         <ol>
            <li>Pull out the bread and place them on a plat</li>
            <li>Add the peanut butter to one slice of bread with a butter knife</li>
            <li>Add the jam to the other slice of bread</li>
            <em>HINT: I like to use a spoon to spread the jam. Plus it makes it easier to get the jam from the jar</em>
            <li>Take your two pieces and slap 'em together</li>
            <li>For best presentation: slice the sandwich from the top left corner down through the bottom right corner. You should be left with two triangles</li>
        </ol>
